- Overlay application support

## WiVRn Version

This client is compatible with WiVRn server version **26.6.2**.

## Prerequisites

### Get the Pico SDK

The Pico Neo 2 SDK is not bundled due to licensing. A helper script downloads and extracts it from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/pico-neo-2-sdks-exes.-7z) bundle.

```bash
./tools/fetch_pico_sdk.sh
```

This places `libPvr_UnitySDK.so`, `libtracking_module.so`, `libnative.so` into `src/app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/` and `pvr_classes.jar` into `src/app/libs/`.

Requires `curl`, `7z` (p7zip-full), `unzip`, and `tar`. On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install p7zip-full unzip`.

CI does this automatically using a `PICO_SDK_DOWNLOAD_URL` secret. If you want to point at a different mirror, pass the URL as the first argument or set `PICO_SDK_DOWNLOAD_URL` in your environment.

If you skip this step, the build will fail with a message telling you exactly what's missing.

### Environment

- Android SDK with NDK 26.3.11579264
- JDK 17
- CMake 3.22.1
- `p7zip-full`, `unzip`, `curl` (for the SDK fetch script)
- Pico Neo 2 with USB debugging enabled

## Building

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/Android/sdk
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$ANDROID_HOME
export ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/26.3.11579264
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-17
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"

./tools/fetch_pico_sdk.sh
cd src
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK will be in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/` (or `release/` for signed release builds).

### Signed release builds

Release signing is configured via `keystore.properties` placed one directory above the gradle project (i.e. at the repo root):

```properties
storeFile=../pico2-wivrn-release.jks
storePassword=your_store_password
keyAlias=pico2-wivrn
keyPassword=your_key_password
```

The keystore file path is relative to `src/`. If the file is absent, release builds are unsigned.

## Installing

```bash
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Or grab a pre-built signed APK from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/openlyst/piconeo2-wivrn/releases).

## Usage

1. Install the WiVRn server on your PC ([WiVRn server setup](https://github.com/WiVRn/WiVRn))
2. Launch the app on your headset
3. Pair with your PC by entering the PIN shown on screen
4. Stream VR games over Wi-Fi or USB
